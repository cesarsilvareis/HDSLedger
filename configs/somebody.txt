C Somebody once told me
C The world is gonna roll me
C I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
C She was looking kinda dumb
C With the finger and her thumb
C In the shape of an "L"
C On her forehead
C Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
C Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
C Didn't make sense not to live for fun
C Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
C So much to do, so much to see
C So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
C You'll never know if you don't go
C You'll never shine if you don't glow
C hehe!
